# Blockchain portfolio

This repository serves as a portfolio of my blockchain and Solidity-related projects. Here, you can find scripts to visualize how a blockchain works, along with various smart contract projects demonstrating different functionalities and use cases.

### Full stack
- [SolidityToken](https://github.com/seeu-inspace/soliditytoken) This project aims to create a token called "SolidityToken $STK". The tokens are then distributed to users who request them from the "SolidityToken Faucet".

### Solidity
- [1_Lottery-BlockVariable.sol](Solidity/1_Lottery-BlockVariable.sol) an example of a smart contract for a lottery system written in Solidity, using `block.timestamp` for randomness;
- [11_MultiSig.sol](Solidity/11_MultiSig.sol) an example of Smart Contract for Multiple Signatures;
- [KittensOnChain](https://github.com/seeu-inspace/kittensonchain) KittensOnChain is a NFT project aim to fix the problem that there are not enough cats on the blockchain.

### JavaScript
- [digitalSignatures.js](JavaScript/digitalSignatures.js) is a simulation of public key cryptography;
- [blockchain.js](JavaScript/blockchain.js) is a simple Proof of Work blockchain simulation;
- [blockchain-explorer.html](JavaScript/blockchain-explorer.html) a simple Ethereum Blockchain Explorer, built using [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/) and [Infura](https://www.infura.io/).
